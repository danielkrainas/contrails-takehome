## âœ¦ Project Overview

This project is a take-home coding assignment for the Contrails group at Breakthrough Energy. It implements a simple, modular REST API using FastAPI, with a focus on clean architecture, reproducibility, and incremental feature development.

## âœ¦ Project Setup

This project is built with **Python 3.11+** and uses **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** for dependency and environment management.

### ðŸ”§ Dependencies

Core dependencies:

* [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - API framework
* [`uvicorn`](https://www.uvicorn.org/) - ASGI server

Dev tools (optional, recommended):

* [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/) - code formatter
* [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) - static type checker
* [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) - unit testing

## âœ¦ Installation Instructions

1. **Install Poetry (if you don't have it):**

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com/danielkrainas/contrails-takehome.git
   cd contrails-takehome
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment (optional):**

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## âœ¦ Running the Server

To start the FastAPI development server on `localhost:8000`:

```bash
make run
```

This will launch the app with live reload via Uvicorn. You can then visit:

```
http://localhost:8000/helloworld
```
